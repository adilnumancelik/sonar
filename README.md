## Abstract

Analyzing the relation between researchers in a domain is possible
*via representing the authors of papers in that domain by a directed graph (DG). Thus, we can find/visualize the highly influential researchers in a domain. 

Please find more details on the project in the [project description](project_description.pdf)

## Main objectives

The main objectives of this project are: 
1. to  construct  a  network  of researchers where  the  nodes  represent  the authors of the selected scientific publications.  
2. to  analyze  the  generated researcher  network using social network analysis  methods to examine  the  relations between researchers 
3. to develop a tool to search and browse the network in accordance with these relations (e.g. the influencers).  
4. to provide a REST API that makes the results of this analysis available.
